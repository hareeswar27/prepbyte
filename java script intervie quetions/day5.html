    <h2>1. What is the for-in loop in JavaScript? Give its syntax</h2>
    <p>
        There are also other types of loops. The for..in loop in JavaScript allows you to iterate over all property keys of an object.
        <b>syntax</b>
    <pre>
        let obj= {
            name:'hari',
            age:24,
        }
        for(i in obj){
            console.log(i);
        }    
    </pre>    
    </p>
    <h2>2. Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in javascript</h2>

    <p>Function scope: Variables that are declared inside a function are called local variables and in the function scope. Local variables are accessible anywhere inside the function. Block scope: Variable that is declared inside a specific block & can't be accessed outside of that block.</p>
    <h2>3. What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?</h2>
    <p>Null: It is the intentional absence of the value. It is one of the primitive values of JavaScript. <br>

        Undefined: It means the value does not exist in the compiler. It is the global object.</p>
    <h2>4. what is Symbol?</h2>
    <p>Symbol is a built-in object whose constructor returns a symbol primitive — also called a Symbol value or just a Symbol — that's guaranteed to be unique</p>
    <h2>5. Write code to explain map and filter in arrays</h2>
    <p><pre>
        let studentRecords = [ {name: 'John', id: 123, marks : 98 },
          {name: 'Baba', id: 101, marks : 23 },
          {name: 'yaga', id: 200, marks : 45 },
          {name: 'Wick', id: 115, marks : 75 } ]

        <b>MAP</b>

          let names = studentRecords.map( stu => stu.name.toUpperCase());
          console.log(names); // logs: [ 'JOHN', 'BABA', 'JOHN', 'WICK' ]

          The above piece of code shows how concise and elegant our code becomes when we use the map function and when we don’t need to define an empty array.
        
          <b>syntax :

            Array.map(callback, thisValue)
        </b>

        <b>filter</b>
        let names = studentRecords.filter(stu => stu.marks > 50);
        console.log(names);
        // logs: [ { name: 'John', id: 123, marks: 98 },{ name: 'Wick', id: 115, marks: 75 }]

        
    </pre>
    <b>Working of filter()</b><br>

    filter() takes the callback function which returns a bool value. If the provided callback returns true, then the object is added to the resultant array. Otherwise, the object is ignored.
</p>
<h2>
    6. Explain passed by value and passed by reference
</h2>
<p>Pass by Value: The method parameter values are copied to another variable and then the copied object is passed, that's why it's called pass by value. Pass by Reference: An alias or reference to the actual parameter is passed to the method, that's why it's called pass by reference.</p>
<h2>7. Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code</h2>
<p>
    <pre>(function(){
        console.log(Math.PI);
    })();</pre><br>
    Self-invoking functions are useful for initialization tasks and for one-time code executions, without the need of creating global variables.
