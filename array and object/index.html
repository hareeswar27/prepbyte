"Question 1 : We are interested in retrieving only the name of the students and all the names should be in caps.
['JOHN', 'BABA', 'YAGA', 'WICK']"
let names = studentRecords.map(hello=>hello.name.toUpperCase());
console.log(names)

"Question 2: Suppose we have the same dataset as above but this time we want to get the details of students who scored more than 50 marks.
[{name: 'John', id: 123, marks : 98 },{name: 'Wick', id: 115, marks : 75 }]"
let names = studentRecords.filter(hello=>hello.marks>50);
console.log(names)

Question 3: Retrieve the details of students who scored more than 50 marks and have id greater than 120.
let names = studentRecords.filter(hello=>hello.marks>50 && hello.id>120);
console.log(names)

Question 4: Consider the same scenario we have discussed above, but this time we would like to know the sum total of the marks of the students.
let sumoftotal = studentRecords.reduce(((hello,hi)=>hello+hi.marks),0);
console.log(sumoftotal)

Question 5: This time we want to get only the names of the students who scored more than 50 marks from the same dataset used above.
let names = studentRecords.filter(hello=>hello.marks>50).map(hello=>hello.name);
console.log(names)
Question 6: This time we are required to print the sum of marks of the students with id > 120.
let names = studentRecords.filter(hello=>hello.id>120).reduce(((hello,hi)=>hello+hi.marks),0);
console.log(names)

Question 7: This time we are required to print the total marks of the students with marks greater than 50 after a grace of 15 marks has been added to those students who scored less than 50.
let names = studentRecords.map(function(hi){ 
    if(hi.marks < 50){
        hi.marks += 15;}
    return hi;
  }).filter(hi => hi.marks > 50).reduce((hello,now) => hello+now.marks, 0);
  console.log(names)
  
Question 8: Create 6 objects , each object will have name, class, roll no as properties. Store these objects in an array of objects. 
let studentRecords = [{name:"jon",class:'6',id:123},
{name:"jon",class:'7',id:1231},
{name:"hari",class:'8',id:1234},
{name:"naz",class:'9',id:12345},
{name:"lal",class:'10',id:123231},
{name:"ram",class:'lkg',id:123122}]
console.log(studentRecords);
